	// This can occur when a service's Init method returns an error or when there are issues
	// with dependency resolution during the construction process.

	// registered with the container. This typically occurs when there's a mismatch between
	// registered services and their dependencies, or when requesting an unregistered service.
	ErrDependencyNotFound = errors.New("dependency not found")

	// is detected in the service registration graph. Circular dependencies prevent the
	// container from determining a valid construction order for services.

	// that has not been built yet. The container must be built using the Build() method
	// before resolving any services.
